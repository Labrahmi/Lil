I want to build a simple API using nodejs, express and mongodb. the db should be local and the API should have the following sub-routes:
- /author
- /books
- /orders

The db should have the following schema:
- Book
  - _id: ObjectId
  - title: String
  - publishingYear: Number
  - genres: [String]
  - authors: [ObjectId]
  - quantity: Number
  - price: Number
  
- Order
  - _id: ObjectId
  - items: [OrderItem]
  - totalPrice: Number
  - date: timestamp

- Author
  - _id: ObjectId
  - name: String
  - country: String
  
// this is an object that represents an item in an order
  OrderItem = {
    bookId: ObjectId,
    amount: Number
  }
  

the API should be restful and respect the following rules:
- clear and consistent naming
- use versioning
- use the appropriate HTTP methods
- return the appropriate status code
- use the appropriate HTTP headers

write a simple code that i can start with, also give me steps to setup the database with a simple documentation.
To create a simple REST API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set up the Project
Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with `npm`.

```bash
mkdir my-api-project
cd my-api-project
npm init -y
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Next, install the required packages: `express` for the server, `mongoose` for MongoDB interaction, and `body-parser` for parsing JSON bodies.

```bash
npm install express mongoose body-parser
```

### Step 3: Set Up MongoDB
For local development, you will need to install MongoDB on your machine. Follow the official [MongoDB installation guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) for your operating system.

Once MongoDB is installed and running, you can use the default `test` database or create a new one for your project.

### Step 4: Initialize Express and Mongoose
Create an `index.js` file with boilerplate code for initializing Express and setting up a connection to MongoDB.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Middleware to parse JSON bodies
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Connect to local MongoDB
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/myapidb', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

// Confirm connection
const db = mongoose.connection;
db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'MongoDB connection error:'));

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Step 5: Define Mongoose Schemas
Add Mongoose schemas for `Book`, `Order`, and `Author` in separate files or as part of `index.js`.

```javascript
const { Schema, model, Types } = mongoose;

const BookSchema = new Schema({
  title: String,
  publishingYear: Number,
  genres: [String],
  authors: [Types.ObjectId],
  quantity: Number,
  price: Number,
});

const AuthorSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  country: String,
});

const OrderItemSchema = new Schema({
  bookId: Types.ObjectId,
  amount: Number,
});

const OrderSchema = new Schema({
  items: [OrderItemSchema],
  totalPrice: Number,
  date: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});

const Book = model('Book', BookSchema);
const Author = model('Author', AuthorSchema);
const Order = model('Order', OrderSchema);
```

### Step 6: Create API Endpoints
Create API endpoints for `/authors`, `/books`, and `/orders`, using the appropriate HTTP methods and returning status codes.

Here's an example of how you might set up the `/authors` route:

```javascript
// GET all authors
app.get('/v1/authors', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const authors = await Author.find();
    res.json(authors);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send(error);
  }
});

// POST a new author
app.post('/v1/authors', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const newAuthor = new Author(req.body);
    const savedAuthor = await newAuthor.save();
    res.status(201).json(savedAuthor);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).send(error);
  }
});
```

You'll need to replicate similar routes for `/books` and `/orders`, following RESTful conventions and handling parameters as needed.

### Step 7: Testing the API
Once you have your routes set up, you can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/) to test your API.

### Step 8: Documentation
Consider creating a simple `README.md` file in which you document your API endpoints, their methods, expected inputs, and outputs. This will be helpful for users trying to interact with your API.

### Finished Index.js Example
Combine the provided code snippets into your `index.js` file, and be sure to implement routes for each of the models with proper handling. Remember, this is a simplified example, and you'll need to flesh out each route to handle CRUD operations according to REST principles.

### Important Notes
- Error handling: Ensure you have proper error handling for the different scenarios that may occur when interacting with the database.
- Validation: Add validation to your schemas to ensure data integrity. Mongoose supports validation out of the box.
- Security: Before deploying your API to production, you'll need to consider security aspects such as input validation, rate limiting, authentication, and CORS.
- Asynchronous Handling: Use async/await or promises for asynchronous code to ensure you are properly handling asynchronous execution flows.

Please follow each step carefully, and remember to expand upon this simple setup to build the actual functionality you need for your API.









-----------------------------------------------------










To implement the new features for your Express.js API, you'll need to modify the existing files and potentially add new ones to accommodate the additional functionality. To help keep things organized and maintainable, you might want to consider grouping related endpoints together in separate Express `Router` modules. Below is an outline of how you might proceed:

### Author Endpoints
1. Update `endpoints/authors.js` with new routes and corresponding controller functions:
   - `PUT /authors/:id` to update an author.
   - `GET /authors/:id/books` to return all books by a specific author with pagination.

### Book Endpoints
2. Update `endpoints/books.js` with new routes and corresponding controller functions:
   - `POST /books` to add one or more books, ensuring the author exists.
   - `DELETE /books/:id` to delete a specific book.
   - `GET /books` to return all books with pagination.
   - `GET /books?name=value` to search for books by title with pagination.
   - `GET /books?genre=value` to filter books by genre with pagination.
   - `GET /books?yearStart=value&yearEnd=value` to filter books by publishing year range with pagination.
   - `GET /books?authorCountry=value` to filter books by the country of the author with pagination.

### Order Endpoints
3. Update `endpoints/orders.js` with new routes and corresponding controller functions:
   - `POST /orders` to add a new order and update book stock.
   - `GET /orders/max-total-price?startDate=value&endDate=value` to find the order with maximum total price in a date range.
   - `GET /orders/popular-genres?startDate=value&endDate=value` to find the three most popular genres in a date range.
   - `GET /orders/total-profit?startDate=value&endDate=value` to find the total profit in a date range.
   - `GET /orders/top-authors?startDate=value&endDate=value` to find the five most bought authors in a date range.

### Helper Functions
4. You'll want to add helper functions within your `models` directory for the database logic, such as:
   - Methods to check if an author exists when adding a book.
   - Methods to update book quantities when creating orders.
   - Functions that perform complex queries for statistics like total profit or most popular authors.

### MongoDB Aggregation
5. For some of the order statistics, you'll likely need to use MongoDB aggregation framework to efficiently calculate results (e.g., popular genres, total profit, most bought authors).

Here's an example of an aggregation that could be used to find the total profit in a date range:

```javascript
Order.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      date: { $gte: new Date(startDate), $lte: new Date(endDate) }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      totalProfit: { $sum: "$totalPrice" }
    }
  }
]);
```

### Index Update
6. Update `index.js` to use new routers:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const authorsRouter = require('./endpoints/authors');
const booksRouter = require('./endpoints/books');
const ordersRouter = require('./endpoints/orders');

const app = express();

app.use(express.json()); // For parsing application/json

// Use routers
app.use('/authors', authorsRouter);
app.use('/books', booksRouter);
app.use('/orders', ordersRouter);

// ... MongoDB connection and app listening code
```

### Schema Alterations
7. You also might need to adjust your Mongoose schemas to support new features as needed, such as tracking book stock, author reference in books, etc.

Remember to handle errors, edge cases, and validate data in your endpoints to ensure the reliability and security of your API. This structure should help lay the groundwork for your expanded API capabilities.
